# content-agent-mcp

This project is an experimental AI-powered content generation pipeline built with:

- **Neon MCP Server** â€“ for implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Inngest AgentKit** â€“ to orchestrate agent functions as serverless events
- **Gemini API** â€“ as the LLM for generating text-based content
- **Database integration** â€“ to store generated content for later use

The goal is to explore agent-based architectures for generating structured content, such as blog posts, summaries, or other text formats, with contextual memory and task orchestration.

## ðŸ§© Tech Stack

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** via [Neon MCP Server](https://github.com/neonsecret/mcp-server)
- **Inngest AgentKit** for event-driven agent workflows
- **Gemini API** (Google) as the large language model
- **Database** (can be PostgreSQL, Supabase, MongoDB, etc.)
- Built with **TypeScript**

---

## ðŸ§  Features

- Set up a local MCP server for managing context, tools, and agent state
- Use Inngest to trigger and manage content creation events
- Call Gemini API to generate relevant content
- Store generated content to a database for further use/display
